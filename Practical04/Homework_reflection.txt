Task 1
1) The code was refactored by separating it as follows: moving business logic into models,
request coordination into controllers and presentation into views. This helps to improve readability
testability and maintainability.
2) The main challenges is to decide which part belongs to the model or controllers. One of the way 
to reduce issues is to test frequently and ensure it works normally as per the initial design.
3) MVC structured is good because it allows us to add or modify the features without touching the large file.\
4) MVC structured makes it easier to understand as it split into models, controllers and views instead of 
everything being in one file (app.js). It makes in clearer where to add or fix stuff. 
5) It makes the code easier to understand and easier to fix without breaking other areas.
Task 2 
1) Implementing input validation middleware helps to catch bad input early and return clear error message
instead of crashing the application. An example is email must be valid or password must be at least 8 characters.
2) Parameterized queries prevent sql injection by keeping the sql code separate from the data. 
The input is treated as a text and not as code so the sql commands is not altered. 
3) We can show generic messages like something is wrong so that the API keeps the sensitive information hidden.
