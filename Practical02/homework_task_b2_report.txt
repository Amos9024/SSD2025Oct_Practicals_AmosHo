Short report
The role of the following elements in the food-api are:
1) app.use(express.json()) 
    app.use is a middleware to parse incoming request with JSON payload. express.json() parse the JSON 
    string and converts it into Javascript object so that we can access it with req.body. 
2) req.body
    req.body sends data by the client in the request body. The data send by the client will be stored or created on the database server. 
3) req.query
    req.query is an object which contains a set of key-value paris representing the query parameters of the URL. 
4) req.params.id
    This allows the server to identify specific resources for data retreiving or updating. 

Using different HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) in an API is significant because it provides a clear, standardized way to describe the intend action on the 
resource, aligning with the principles of RESTful architecture. 
Here's how they (CRUD) are relate to HTTP Methods as follows:
1) POST   -> Create
2) GET    -> Read
3) PUT    -> Update
4) DELETE -> DELETE

Explain the meaning of these HTTP status codes:
200 OK -> This is a Standard success status code. THis indicates that the client's request was successfully received. 
201 Created -> This is success code indicates that the request has been fulfilled and resulted in a creation of new resource.
400 Bad Request -> This is a client error code indicating that the server will not process the request because it is perceived to be a client error. 
404 Not Found -> This is a client error code indciating that the server cannot find the requested resource. 
500 Internal Server Error -> This is generic server code indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
